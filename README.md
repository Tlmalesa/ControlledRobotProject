# ControlledRobotProject
Robotic Project Using Arduino IDE to develop a robot project for kids using different sensors.

* I used Ultrasonic Sensor for checking the distance of the robot.
* RGB for choosing different colours you want
* Buzzer for creating different tones(I did Siren tone and do-reh-mi-fah-soh-lah.... tone)
* DC motors for controlling the robot(Moving Forward,Backwards,left and right)
* All sensors are connected to nodeMCU
